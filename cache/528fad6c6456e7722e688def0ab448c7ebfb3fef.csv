","[{'comment_body': ""Don't you also have to remove the `traffic_ops_ort.pl` script? Since you're removing a dependency on the ability to run it.""}, {'comment_body': 'The perl scripts, namely `supermicro_udev_mapper.pl`, are still referenced in the ansible roles. #7829 removes them, but #7829 should not be merged until the changes to those ansible roles are tested (and the ansible role testers I know of are currently blocked by an unrelated thing). So #7832 is an attempt to remove what Perl stuff can be removed without breaking the ansible roles.'}]"
