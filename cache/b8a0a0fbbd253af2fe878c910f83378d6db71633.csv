","[{'comment_body': ""> I'm assuming you opened this PR to look for feedback, even though it's still a draft. I realize parts of it aren't ready for that yet, but I commented on them a couple times anyway, just in case. The table controller looks _mostly_ good, although I haven't compared it to the functionality of the TPv1 counterpart. Obviously testing needs a lot of work. I'm gonna try to work on migrating our tests to cypress over the holidays, which will hopefully make the e2e testing easier.\r\n\r\nYeah, I made it in draft because it's not ready for review yet. But thanks for your review, I'll check it. The code is copied from some other components and some parts I didn't change it ^^""}, {'comment_body': '@ocket8888 Can you take a look?'}]"
