to

```shell
./traffic_ops_${api_version}_integration_test -test.v -test.run '^TestLoginWithCert$' -cfg=traffic-ops-test.conf -fixtures=tc-fixtures-${api_version}.json 2>&1 | ./go-junit-report --package-name=golang.test.toapi.${api_version} --set-exit-code > /junit/golang.test.toapi.${api_version}.xml && find /junit -type 'f' | xargs chmod 664
```

in order to save time by not running all of the tests, then run the API tests in CDN in a Box.
