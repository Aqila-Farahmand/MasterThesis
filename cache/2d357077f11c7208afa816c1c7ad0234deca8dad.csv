This PR makes it so that GHA workflows only run when files are changed. Previously, all GHAs workflows were being run when a branch was created (`create` trigger), so if the GHA workflow was also triggered by paths under the `push` trigger, each such GHA workflow would run twice, which is unnecessary.

This PR also disables the ansible/molecule GHA workflows, since they always fail.
