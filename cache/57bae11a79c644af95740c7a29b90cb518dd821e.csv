Yes, you read that right. No, it's not a typo. Traffic Ops will refuse to load
a configuration file that gives the Traffic Ops Golang port as an integer
instead of a string.

It also removes support for Python 2, including a code-level compatibility; this won't just not try to run with Python 2 by default, it is now syntactically incompatible with that dead language. Also, as Python3.6 is already end-of-life, the requirement is now Python 3.8+ (EOL November 2024, I believe).
