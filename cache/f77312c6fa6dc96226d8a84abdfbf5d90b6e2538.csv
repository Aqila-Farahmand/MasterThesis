Closes: #7860
Rocky Linux 9 has changed the database format for the RPM database. This causes the RPM DB check to fail and t3c will not run in badass mode. 

t3c has been updated to detect RPM database type and use the proper check for the database detected. If the RPM database type can not be determined the check will be skipped. Note that sqlite type database will only be checked if sqlite is installed on the cache. If it is not installed the check will be skipped.
