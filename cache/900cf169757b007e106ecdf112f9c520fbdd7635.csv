This PR

- changes configuration to log Traffic Router to /var/log/traffic_router instead of /opt/traffic_router/var/log
- changes configuration to log Traffic Monitor to /var/log/traffic_monitor instead of /opt/traffic_monitor/var/log
- changes configuration to log Traffic Stats to /var/log/traffic_stats instead of /opt/traffic_stats/var/log

 so that the logs are on a different partition than the application itself.
