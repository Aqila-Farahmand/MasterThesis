<blockquote>
<h2>v1.2.28</h2>
<pre><code>v1.2.28 09 Jan 2024
[Security Fixes]
  * [jws] JWS messages formated in full JSON format (i.e. not the compact format, which
    consists of three base64 strings concatenated with a '.') with missing &quot;protected&quot;
    headers could cause a panic, thereby introducing a possiblity of a DoS.
<pre><code>This has been fixed so that the `jws.Parse` function succeeds in parsing a JWS message
lacking a protected header. Calling `jws.Verify` on this same JWS message will result
in a failed verification attempt. Note that this behavior will differ slightly when
parsing JWS messages in compact form, which result in an error.
