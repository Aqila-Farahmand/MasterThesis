Update workflows to use environment file instead of deprecated `set-output` command. 
For more information, see: [https://github.blog/changelog/2022-10-11-github-actions-deprecating-save-state-and-set-output-commands/](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-10-11-github-actions-deprecating-save-state-and-set-output-commands/)

I found the workflow files that use `set-output` command through the following command:

```bash
$ find . -name '*.yml' -o -name '*.yaml' | xargs egrep '\bset-output\b'
```

**AS-IS**

```yaml
run: echo ""::set-output name=value::$(cat GO_VERSION)""
```

**TO-BE**

```yaml
run: echo ""value=$(cat GO_VERSION)"" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```
