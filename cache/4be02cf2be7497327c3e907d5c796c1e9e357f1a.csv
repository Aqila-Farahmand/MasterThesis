This PR fixes some issues with paths in `optional/docker-compose.traffic-portal-v2-test.yml` that arose when it was moved to the optional directory. Apparently `docker-compose` always uses the directory that the first compose file specified with `-f` is in for the base of all relative paths.

## What is the best way to verify this PR?
<!-- Please include here ALL the steps necessary to test your PR.
If your PR has tests (and most should), provide the steps needed to run the tests.

```shell
cd infrastructure/cdn-in-a-box
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f optional/docker-compose.traffic-portal-v2.yml -f optional/docker-compose.traffic-portal-v2-test.yml build tpv2-e2e-test
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f optional/docker-compose.traffic-portal-v2.yml -f optional/docker-compose.traffic-portal-v2-test.yml up --no-deps tpv2-e2e-test
```
(It's fine if it starts to start up as long as building the docker image succeeded, we're mainly only testing that the compose file can be used.)
