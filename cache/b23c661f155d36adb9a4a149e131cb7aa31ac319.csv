The symlinks created in #7999 work, but only for fresh installs, not upgrades. #8001 fixes that by
- Moving existing logs in `/opt/<component>/var/log` to `/var/log/<component>`
- Not creating a symlink inside the symlink target if the symlink target already exists and is a directory

## What is the best way to verify this PR?
<!-- Please include here ALL the steps necessary to test your PR.

1. Build the RPMs
   ```shell
   ./pkg -v traffic_monitor_build traffic_stats_build traffic_router_build
   ```

2. Verify that files that exist in the old log directories pre-install are moved to the new log directories
   ```shell
   <<'SHELL_COMMANDS' docker run --rm -i -v $(pwd)/dist:/dist rockylinux:8 bash
   set -o errexit
   mkdir -p /opt/traffic_{monitor,stats,router}/var/log
   touch /opt/traffic_{monitor,stats,router}/var/log/my-logfile.log
   rpm -Uvh --nodeps dist/traffic_monitor-8.1.0-12410.cff72c19.el8.x86_64.rpm dist/traffic_router-8.1.0-12410.cff72c19.el8.noarch.rpm dist/traffic_stats-8.1.0-12410.cff72c19.el8.x86_64.rpm
   ls -1 /var/log/traffic_{monitor,stats,router}/my-logfile.log
   SHELL_COMMANDS
   ```

   Expected output:

   ```shell
   /var/log/traffic_monitor/my-logfile.log
   /var/log/traffic_router/my-logfile.log
   /var/log/traffic_stats/my-logfile.log
   ```
