This PR creates symlinks from `/opt/<component>/var/log` to `/var/log/<component>` for the log directories that were moved in #7979. This is useful if you have any code or configuration still referencing `/opt/<component>/var/log`, because it buys some time to change those references to `/var/log/<component>`, rather than requiring that everything is changed all at once, whenever you deploy #7979.

Because this is intended as a temporary measure, these symlinks are deprecated with the intent of removing them in ATC 9.0.0, assuming there is a release before then that *does* include the symlinks.
